    "**Due Date**: 9/8/24 by 8pm on Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, you are going to write a task organizer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will say that the task organizer follows this general pattern: `{priority_level: [(task, due_date)]}`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three priority levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- high\n",
    "- medium\n",
    "- low\n",
    "\n",
    "This task organizer requires the use of multiple Python data structures (list, dictionary, tuple). The outer structure is a dictionary. We will use the priority level as the key. For the value, we will use a list of tuples. Within each tuple, the first element is a description of the task, while the second value is the due date to complete that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task organizer has three different features: **add**, **remove**, and **display**. You are welcome to work on these features in whichever order you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work on this by yourself or with one other person in the class. If you are working as a group, only one person needs to submit the assignment on Canvas, but make sure to write who you worked with as a submission comment!"

    "- the task description can't be empty\n",
    "- the priority level has to be either high, medium, or low\n",
    "- the due date has to be a valid (e.g., day must exist in given month, cannot be in the past)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use `date.today()` to create an object that represents the current date on your machine\n",
    "- If you construct an invalid `date` (like February 31st, 2024), an exception is raised by Python\n",
    "- You can use a `try/except` block to check for raised errors (see this quick [explanation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp))\n",
    "- You can use relational operators (such as `>`, `<`, and `==`) to compare `date` objects"
